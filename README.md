## Skills

Talking about My Skills, I was very fond of technologies since my school days. I started with python and worked with various libraries, also did Mysql for DBM. I explored C when I came to college and moved to C++. I started with the basics of C++ then gradually moved towards concepts of Object Oriented Programming in C++ and then started with Data Structures And Algorithms in it. In parallel, I started with Web Development, in which I did HTML, CSS, and chose Bootstrap for further exploration and then completed JavaScript. After that, I started with React js and Currently I am working on MERN Stack.
